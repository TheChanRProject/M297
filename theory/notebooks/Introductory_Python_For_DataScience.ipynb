    "##### integers: which are whole numbers\n",
    "##### floating: which are numbers with decimal\n",

    "### Strings: \n",
    "##### Strings are collections of letters or words In Python, you can create strings by enclosing single or double quotes\n",

    "### Lists:\n",
    "##### The list type is a container that holds bunch of objects in a given order and it also allows you to add and remove objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples: \n",
    "##### A tuple is a sequence of immutable objects they are just like lists The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.\n",

    "### Dictionaries:\n",
    "##### A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of items that contain two element and they are keys and values "
