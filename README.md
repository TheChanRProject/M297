# M297: An Introduction to Data and Decision Science 

This is a repository for a course I'm teaching at Claremont Splash 2019 which takes place on the campus of Harvey Mudd College. M297 is a course that has 3 main objectives:  

1. Be able to distinguish the buzz words associated with Data and Decision Science with a clear understanding of what everything means in the data and decision ecosystem.

	- Data Science 
	- Decision Science 
	- Machine Learning 
	- Deep Learning
	- Big Data 
	- Data Engineering 
	- Artificial Intelligence 
	- Cognitive Computing & Cognitive Intelligence
	- Quantum Data Science & Machine Learning

2. Be able to explain how these disciplines affect entrepreneurship and how students become active "datapreneurs" with a strong foundation in decision science. 

3. To conduct a hands-on workshop with the Boston Housing Dataset on Kaggle and work with regression techniques stemming from univariate and multivariate statistics and the Analogizing and Connectionist tribes of machine learning. 

Approach for Theory:

1. Mining many articles on data science and decision science for coming up with an eclectic resource for students to draw information from.

2. Be able to explain the Venn Diagram 2.0 for Data Science and to also come up with an illustration of where Decision Science fits into the visualization. 

3. Be able to show powerful trends for job prospects, economical changes, and demographics within the fields to inspire students to pursue the field. 

4. Introduce a high-level overview of Data Science as a "science", machine learning and why it is used, sources of data and how statistics knowledge is used to turn any kind of messy data into a usable form of data, and also a brief overview of scalability (big data) and the 5 tribes of machine learning by Pedro Domingos.  

5. Introduce a detailed and personalized learning path for students to venture into data science on their own, without following the herd and feeling bogged down along the way.


Approach for the Hands-On Workshop:

1. Build introductory Python notebooks to be able to use enough Python to work with Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

2. Build a notebook on exploratory data analysis for understanding the Boston Housing Dataset. 

	- Loading Data with reader modules (File I/O, Pandas)
	- Visualizing Statistical Features of the Data 
		- Spread
		- Shape 
		- Homoskedasticity  
		- Fitting Histograms Onto a Normal Distribution of the Column
		- Multicollinearity and its Implications 

3. Build a notebook on using Simple Linear Regression for predicting Boston House prices. 

4. Build a notebook on using Multivariate Linear Regression for predicting Boston House prices. 

5. Build a notebook on Optimization for Best Regression Results: 

	- Gradient Descent 
	- Overfitting 
	- Regularization 

6. Build a notebook on understanding Neural Networks at a High Level

7. Build a notebook on Support Vector Machines at a High Level 

8. Build a notebook on Bayesian Inference at a High Level 

9. Build a notebook on Transformations on Regression Techniques:

	- Deep Neural Network Regressor 
	- Support Vectorized Linear Regression 
	- Bayesian Linear Regression
